# RaspberryPi_MC_launcher
Managing several MC Java servers on a RaspberryPi is troublesome. So I write this launcher to make things easier.

All Minecraft instances and must be stored in ~/Minecraft , it's also where I put the lock file, which contains the path to the currently running Minecraft server instance.

Up to v0.16, the lock files are generated by the script called during the Minecraft launching process, not by the launcher itself. In future versions,  I will attempt to have the launcher handle the creation of lock files.


Update logs:
v0.10: The initial version of the project. Its only function is listing the servers and allows the user to choose which to run.
v0.12: Added the lock file. It will no longer ask user to choose a server to run when a server is already running, instead, it will show information about the running server.
v0.14: Now the launcher would handle the situation where Minecraft services go into "failed" state.
v0.15: Now the launcher would handle all situations where Minecraft services malfunction. In this case, a new debug option "show logs" is added, allowing user to check what happened during the last screen session.
v0.16(Undone yet): Will enable the launcher to upgrade itself when a newer version is detected in ~/Minecraft . Will also prompt user to input a Minecraft server url for a reminder on first launch.
